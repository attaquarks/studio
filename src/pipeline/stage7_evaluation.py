# --- Evaluation Disabled ---
# As per user request, no validation/test split is performed during training.
# Therefore, this evaluation stage is currently disabled.
# To enable evaluation, modify Stage 1 to create a validation/test split,
# and then implement the evaluation logic here using the test dataloader
# and appropriate metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR for reports, Accuracy/F1 for VQA).
